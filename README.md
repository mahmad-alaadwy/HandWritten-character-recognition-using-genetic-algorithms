# HandWritten character recognition using genetic algorithms
 
Handwriting Recognition enables a person to scribble something on a paint window and then convert it into text.
If we look into the practical reality there are enumerable styles in which a character may be written.
These styles can be self combined to generate more styles.
Even if a small child knows the basic styles a character can be written,
he would be able to recognize characters written in styles intermediate between them or formed by their mixture.
This motivates the use of Genetic Algorithms for the problem.
